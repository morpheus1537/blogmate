Implement the following key features:
1. AI-Powered Content Assistant
2. Drag-and-Drop Editor
3. SEO Optimization with AI
4. Customizable AI Templates
5. Mobile Responsiveness
6. Product Integration (e.g., Shopify)
7. Social Media Integration with AI assistance
8. Google Docs and Markdown Import
9. Lazy Loading Images
10. Newsletter and Lead Capture with AI optimization
11. App Integrations
12. AI-Enhanced Analytics

For each feature, create the necessary components, functions, and API endpoints.
```

## Strict Rules

```
While building the app, adhere to these strict rules:
1. Ensure data privacy and GDPR compliance
2. Implement ethical AI practices
3. Optimize for performance
4. Follow WCAG accessibility guidelines
5. Implement robust security measures
6. Design for scalability
7. Implement comprehensive testing
8. Maintain clear documentation
9. Use Git for version control
10. Ensure responsive design across all devices
```

## Directory Structure Modifications

```
Based on our current directory structure, make the following modifications:

1. In the 'src/components' directory, create subdirectories for major features:
   - Editor/
   - SEOTools/
   - AIAssistant/

2. Create a 'tests' directory at the root level with subdirectories:
   - unit/
   - integration/
   - e2e/

3. Create a 'docs' directory at the root level with subdirectories:
   - api/
   - user-guide/

4. Create a 'scripts' directory at the root level for any build or deployment scripts.

5. Create a 'config' directory at the root level for configuration files.

Please update the directory structure and create placeholder files where necessary.
```

## Implementation Instructions

### AI-Powered Content Assistant

```
Let's start by implementing the AI-Powered Content Assistant. Please create the necessary components, API endpoints, and utility functions for this feature. Include the ability to generate ideas, outlines, and draft content for blog posts.
```

### SEO Optimization

```
For the SEO Optimization feature, please implement an AI-driven tool that can analyze blog post content and provide SEO scores and improvement suggestions. Show me the main component for this feature and explain how it interacts with the AI backend.
```

## Next Steps

Continue this process for each feature, providing specific instructions for implementation. After each feature is implemented, review and test the code, and ask for modifications or improvements as needed.

Remember to integrate each new feature with the existing codebase and ensure it adheres to the project's architectural patterns and coding standards.

As you progress, you may need to refine the project structure, add new dependencies, or create additional utility functions. Be sure to update the project documentation accordingly.
